Hullo and welcome to the blog.

##My first bake
So far this all looks good. There are some gaps in the flooring and the security is __AWFUL__ and the speed isn't all the way there but i will say that it has the best format for storing pages. It hasn't got a huge database labeled swag. It dosn't use amazons *HUGE*  S3 servers to keep it running. It uses a simple bit of [MarkDown](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=markdown) which is a beautiful technology that allows people to use any editor, from notepad to a javascript website, to write a fully formatted document and Bread(C) will convert that into a website. None of this wordpress bloatware, just a simple drag and drop and its on the navbar.

##Light as a feather.

So you might ask me, this system sounds simple but it must at least these 2 flaws:

    + Terrible response times
    + No support for plugins, extras or awesome stuff like wordpress has.
    
You would be suprised yet again as the response times are much better for smaller websites (less than 1000 pages) than my previous site and by 0.3 we will be fully focused on trimming 0.100ms response times to 0.010ms.

Furthermore since we added json files to 'index' files properly, you can add php files as plugins to slot in where the posts usually go. So if your a decent programmer and want to make a clean new home page, or a video streamer using HTML5 then you can without any massive changes.

The best bit is that Bread is clone and drop. As in you can clone it from GitHub, make a few changes here and there and boom you have a website as long as your hoster provides php5 (and really it should ;) .)

##Flaws
The only real flaws are:

    + Security needs improvement
    + Themes will be added in the future.
    
The second point is more crucial. Currently i am using foundation 4 which is great but all the pages are hard coded to use it and no extra themeing is used at present. This is something we will be looking into as soon as 0.2 - Stylish Sauce.
