dev-bread
=====
##Info

This is the preferred version of bread as we phase out the old and clunky bread branch (now called stalebread).
The new version helps us achieve all of our aims which were harder to do in our previous effort, no functionality will
be taken from stale though, we plan to make devbread better in every respect.

A plain blogging platform making use of markdown and php.
The aims of the project are to:
* To be able to edit websites as you view them, and update them live.
* Be a light engine that doesn't lean towards either too many features or overkill preformance
* Have a easy to understand php structure that people can edit and write modules with.
* Be so easy to set up that anyone could run a blog within 2 minutes.


##Usage

Documentation: http://half-shot.github.io/bread/

The Core system is expected to shift around until 0.3 where things are expected to stabilize
but even at 0.1 hopefully most of the system is in concrete.

##Whats done/todo:

This list needs to be done XD
