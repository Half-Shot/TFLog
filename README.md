##Info
A plain blogging platform making use of markdown and php.
The aims of the project are to:
* To be able to edit websites as you view them, and update them live.
* Be a light engine that doesn't lean towards either too many features or overkill preformance
* Have a easy to understand php structure that people can edit and write modules with.
* Be so easy to set up that anyone could run a blog within 2 minutes.

The project also makes extensive use of foundation 4. 
To add your own theming you will have to modify the php source. *This will be changed at a later date ;)*

##Usage

Although we do not reccomend usage just yet as there is a state of flux in the space-time continuium and
as such we think its best to wait a few more revisions until the security is bolted down and an editor is added.

If you want to try it then *check through the core/config.php file to make changes.*

Have fun and remember if you want fixes/features, you MUST add issues to git.
